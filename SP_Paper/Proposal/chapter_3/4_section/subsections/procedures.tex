\label{subsec:procedures}
In this section, the step-by-step procedures that 
will be followed in line with the development and testing of the system; 
alamAPI. Whereas the following are the procedures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)]	Designing of the System Architecture for alamAPI
    \item[(b)]	Designing of Machine Learning Model
    \item[(c)]	Development of System Prototype
    \item[(d)]	Training, Testing, and Evaluation of the Machine Learning Model
    \item[(e)]	Integration of the Machine Learning Model to the alamAPI
    \item[(f)]	Initial testing for alamAPI, this shall also include any debugging, 
    bug fixing, and code refactoring.
    \item[(g)]	Pre-deployment testing, this testing phase includes the 
    following tests that will be done for a one-month continuous system operation:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Functional Testing, by monitoring the functionality of 
            the alamAPI over 30 days and checking the success and error logs at 
            the end of the given timeframe.
            \item Stress Testing, by creating ten-million artificial requests 
            to the API everyday for 30 days.
        \end{itemize}
    \item[(h)]	Logging and summarization of results from all the prior 
    tests conducted
    \item[(i)]	Analysis and discussion of test data results.
    \item[(j)]	Code Documentation
    \item[(k)]	Maintenance, which will span beyond the time scope of the 
    special problem.
\end{itemize}
