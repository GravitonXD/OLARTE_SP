\subsection{Software Development Process}
\label{subsec:soft_dev}
Due to the expected heavy time constraints of the development of the system, 
the author of this paper decided to follow an Agile Software Development Process, 
primarily it will be using Agile Sprints for an efficient time management 
during the whole software development process. Wherein the following are the 
list of Sprints and sub-activities that will be followed are shown in the 
Table below:

\vspace{0.5cm}
From Table \ref{summary-sprints}, it is 
shown that there is a total of 39 weeks; from September 15, 2022, 
to June 17, 2023, however it must be noted that an additional 1 week 
was added to each sprint’s allotted time to compensate for any unforeseen 
events during each sprint.
\vspace{0.5cm}
\\ It should also be noted that Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 overlaps as 
the development of the prototype will start at Week 3, this will 
be possible as there will already be an initial system design to be followed, 
and any changes made during Sprint 1 can easily be adjusted to the creation of 
the prototype of the system in Sprint 2. This is also the case for Sprints 4 and 5, 
since their activities overlaps with each other, such that there are things in 
Sprint 4 that are unsupervised, hence, to better manage the time it is reasonable 
to start the activities of Sprint 5 along side the later parts of Sprint 4.

\\ Moreover, the full details about the scheduling will be 
further discussed in the Gantt Chart of this chapter.
