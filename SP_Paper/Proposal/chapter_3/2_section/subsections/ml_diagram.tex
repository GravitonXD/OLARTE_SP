\subsection{Machine Learning Model Diagram}
\label{subsec:ml_diagram}
In this section, the process on how the machine learning model 
will be developed is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ml_model}. 
Wherein, the process overview is based on the Fine-Tuned Support 
Vector Regression Model for Stock Predictions by 
\citeA{Dash2016}.
