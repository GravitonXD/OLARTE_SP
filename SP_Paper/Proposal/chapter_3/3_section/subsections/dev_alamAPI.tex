\subsection{For the Development of the alamAPI, and Training 
and Testing of the Machine Learning Model}
\label{subsec:alamAPI_hardware}
To develop the alamAPI and the underlying system that it utilizes, 
the project developer would be needing a laptop with at least the 
following minimum requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] A desktop class 4-core CPU running on 2GHz (minimum).
    \item[(b)] 16 GB of Random Access Memory (RAM). 
    This is to ensure that multiple instances of programs 
    can run efficiently in the system.
    \item[(c)] An up-to-date GPU with CUDA cores, this will be used 
    specifically for faster training and testing of the machine learning model. 
    Although if this is not available then a more powerful CPU maybe required.
\end{itemize}
