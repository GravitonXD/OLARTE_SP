% Background and Rationale
\section{Background and Rationale}
\label{sec:background}
The stock market is a type of market that allows companies to raise capital 
by issuing shares of stock to investors. These shares represent a share of 
ownership in the company and entitle the holder to a share of the company's 
profits and voting rights. The stock market also provides a platform for 
investors to buy and sell these shares, allowing for the efficient trading of 
company ownership. By allowing companies to raise capital and investors to buy and 
sell shares, the stock market plays a crucial role in the growth and development 
of the economy
\cite{Chen2022, TheEconomicTimes}.
\\Contrary to popular belief, the stock market is not a form of gambling. 
It involves a significant amount of analytical thinking and risk management, 
and the returns are based on the supply and demand for a given stock, rather 
than on false promises or assurances. In other words, the stock market is a 
legitimate platform for investing and generating returns, rather than a scam or 
gamble
\cite{Schwab-Pomerantz2021,Adams2022,Summers2022}.

% The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
\subsection{The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)}
The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), Inc. is the official stock exchange 
market in the Philippines. It is a non-stock company that was incorporated 
in 1992 and manages and operates the stock market in the country. Registered 
individuals can participate in market exchanges on the PSE.
\cite{PSECompanyInfo}.
\\Moreover, the main index of the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) 
is the Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PSEI). The PSEI is a market 
capitalization-weighted price index that is based on the 30 largest and 
most actively traded companies on the PSE. These companies are pre-determined 
based on strict criteria, such as liquidity and market capitalization. 
The PSEI is often used as a benchmark for the performance of the overall stock 
market in the Philippines.  
\cite{BSP}
The companies that make up the PSEI are often referred to as blue-chip companies, 
as they are typically large, well-established companies with a history of strong 
financial performance. As of October 2022, there are 286 companies listed on the PSE,
 providing a diverse range of investment opportunities for investors. 
\cite{Fayed2022, PSECompanyList}.

% Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment
\subsection{Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment}
It is commonly accepted that the stock market plays a crucial role in economic growth,
 as it allocates and provides capital to businesses, which in turn drives economic
  activity and growth. This is evident from the fact that stock market performance
   is often correlated with a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  
  \cite{TradeBrains, Hall2022, Bae2017}
  Additionally, historical trends in stock prices can provide insight into 
  broader economic movements 
\cite{Campbell2021}.
\\Moreover, a study by \citeA{Balaba2017} found that the stock market has a 
positive effect on the economy of the Philippines. The data from the study 
showed that as the stock market grew, the country's unemployment rate declined. 
This is because the stock market's performance leads to job creation, which in 
turn drives economic growth. This relationship has been evident in the Philippines 
for the past 10 years.

% Benefits of Invesitng for the Individual
\subsection{Benefits of Investing for the Individual}
The Philippine Stock Exchange allows individuals in the Philippines
 to trade shares of listed companies. Investing in the stock market can provide 
 several benefits for an individual, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Protecting the value of an individual's money from inflation: Inflation 
    in the Philippines was at 6.9\% as of September 2022 
    \cite{tradingEconomics}, 
    while savings account deposit interest rates are only between 1-3\% annually 
    \cite{BSP19}. 
    This means that savings in deposit banks may not keep pace with inflation, 
    potentially reducing the purchasing power of an individual's money 
    \cite{RBC, EdwardJones}.
    \item[(b)] (b)	Providing opportunities for capital growth: 
    Investing in the stock market can provide individuals with the p
    otential for significant capital growth, without the need for direct 
    involvement in business operations. This can be beneficial for individuals
    such as students or working professionals, who can grow their capital while 
    focusing on their studies or careers
    \cite{USSecAndExComm}.
\end{itemize}

% Utilization of Machine Learning in Stock Market Trading
\subsection{Utilization of Machine Learning in Stock Market Trading}
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in applying machine 
learning techniques to predict the movement of the stock market, both in the short 
and long term. As a result, there have been numerous studies and practical 
applications that have explored the use of machine learning in this context. 
These efforts aim to improve the accuracy of stock market predictions and help 
investors make informed decisions about their investments. 
\cite{Kumbure2022, Strader2020, Soni2022, Rea2020, Guo2022}.
 Wherein, one of the common techniques used in machine learning for 
 stock market prediction is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). 
 A study by \citeA{Budiharto2021} found that LSTM was effective in predicting the 
 Indonesian stock market by 95\% using short-term data. 
 This indicates that LSTM can be a valuable tool for making short-term stock 
 market predictions.
\\Recently, the use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) 
for predicting stock market price trends has gained momentum in the financial 
and scientific communities. DMD is a mathematical method that can be used 
to identify patterns and trends in complex data sets, such as stock market data.
By applying DMD to stock market data, it is possible to make more accurate 
predictions about future stock price movements. This can help investors make
informed decisions about their investments and potentially generate better returns.
In connection to this, a study by \citeA{Lu2020} found that DMD can be a 
faster predictor than Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), but 
it is less accurate.
\\Furthermore, other studies have shown that DMD can be effectively 
applied to the Turkish and Indian stock markets to predict market price trends
\cite{Savas2017, Kuttichira2017}.
These studies indicate that DMD is easy to implement and can be a useful 
tool for making stock market predictions.
