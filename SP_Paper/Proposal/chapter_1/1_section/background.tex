The stock market is a type of market that allows companies to raise capital 
by issuing shares of stock to investors. These shares represent a share of 
ownership in the company and entitle the holder to a share of the company's 
profits and voting rights. The stock market also provides a platform for 
investors to buy and sell these shares, allowing for the efficient trading of 
company ownership. By allowing companies to raise capital and investors to buy and 
sell shares, the stock market plays a crucial role in the growth and development 
of the economy
\cite{Chen2022, TheEconomicTimes}.
\\Contrary to popular belief, the stock market is not a form of gambling. 
It involves a significant amount of analytical thinking and risk management, 
and the returns are based on the supply and demand for a given stock, rather 
than on false promises or assurances. In other words, the stock market is a 
legitimate platform for investing and generating returns, rather than a scam or 
gamble
