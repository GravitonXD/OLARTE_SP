\subsection{Benefits of Investing for the Individual}
The Philippine Stock Exchange allows individuals in the Philippines
 to trade shares of listed companies. Investing in the stock market can provide 
 several benefits for an individual, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Protects the value of an individual's money from inflation: Inflation 
    in the Philippines was at 6.9\% as of September 2022 
    \cite{tradingEconomics}, 
    while savings account deposit interest rates are only between 1-3\% annually 
    \cite{BSP19}. 
    This means that savings in deposit banks may not keep pace with inflation, 
    potentially reducing the purchasing power of an individual's money 
    \cite{RBC, EdwardJones}.
    \item[(b)] Provides opportunities for capital growth: 
    Investing in the stock market can provide individuals with the potential 
    for significant capital growth, without the need for direct 
    involvement in business operations. This can be beneficial for individuals
    such as students or working professionals, who can grow their capital while 
    focusing on their studies or careers
    \cite{USSecAndExComm}.
