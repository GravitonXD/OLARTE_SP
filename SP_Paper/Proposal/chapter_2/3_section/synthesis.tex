Fast and accurate market information is an essential tool 
for stock market participants. In recent years, the development 
of machine learning models for the financial markets, such as stocks, 
has proven to be increasingly effective in predicting future stock prices and trends. 
The use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in the stock market has also been shown 
to be effective in predicting stock price trends. The simplicity and elegance of 
the Koopman Decomposition Operator make it an ideal basis for the development of 
a Stock Market Price Trend Forecasting System (SMPTF System).

These studies are crucial for the development of the alamAPI to 
provide investors with fast and accurate information about which stocks are 
likely to go up or down, allowing them to make more informed decisions about 
buying or selling those stocks.

In addition to the potential benefits for investors and traders, the 
implementation of machine learning techniques in the stock market can also 
help improve market efficiency and reduce the risk of market manipulation. 
By providing a more accurate and comprehensive view of market trends, 
these techniques can help ensure that prices reflect the true value of 
stocks and other assets, leading to more stable and fair market conditions.
