\subsection{Comparison of Machine Learning Models in Stock Market Predictions}
\label{subsec:comparison_ml}
To have a better grasp in the accuracy of the different models 
used in algorithmic trading it is essential that different models are 
compared against each other.

\subsubsection{Combination of Computational Efficient Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (CEFLANN) and Traditional Technical Analysis}
\label{subsubsec:ceflann}
This hybrid model combines a classification-based model: CEFLANN and 
the traditional technical analysis to create a stock trading framework 
\citeA{Dash2016}, which the results show a profit of 24.29\%.
\subsubsection{Deep Long Short-Term Neural Network (LSTM) with Embedded Layer}
\label{subsubsec:lstm}
In one of the models developed by \citeA{Pang2020}, 
it shows that by adding an embedded layer to the LSTM it yields to a 
stock market price prediction accuracy of 57.2\%. 
However, its accuracy dips to 52.4\% when the model is applied to individual stocks.
\subsubsection{LSTM with Automatic Encoder}
\label{subsubsec:lstm_autoencoder}
As part of the second model developed by \citeA{Pang2020}, this model 
shows a slightly inaccurate stock market prediction, by only having 
a measured accuracy of 56.9\%. 
However, compared to the first model developed by the group this is 0.1\%
more effective for individual stocks.
\subsubsection{Optimal Deep Learning (ODL)}
\label{subsubsec:odl}
In the study conducted by \citeA{Agrawal2019} they have created a 
stock price prediction model using an Optimal Deep Learning (ODL) 
which combine the concepts of Correlation-Tensor and an Optimal LSTM algorithm. 
Whereas their results show a mean and highest accuracy of the model as 59.24\% 
and 65.64\%.
\subsubsection{NMC-BERT-LSTM-DQN-X Algorithm}
\label{subsubsec:nmc_bert_lstm_dqn_x}
More recently, a team have applied a combination of three models for 
forecasting the market trends. Namely, (1) Non-stationary Markov Chain (NMC), 
(2) Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), 
(3) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Wherein their model shows an accuracy of 61.77\%. 
Furthermore, the team also mentioned that the model produces 29.25\% 
annual return on investment, with a maximum losses rating of -8.29\% 
\cite{Liu2022}.
