   abstract = {<p>The stock market is highly volatile and complex in nature. Technical analysts often apply Technical Analysis (TA) on historical price data, which is an exhaustive task and might produce incorrect predictions. The machine learning coupled with fundamental and / or Technical Analysis also yields satisfactory results for stock market prediction. In this work an effort is made to predict the price and price trend of stocks by applying optimal Long Short Term Memory (O-LSTM) deep learning and adaptive Stock Technical Indicators (STIs). We also evaluated the model for taking buy-sell decision at the end of day. To optimize the deep learning task we utilized the concept of Correlation-Tensor built with appropriate STIs. The tensor with adaptive indicators is passed to the model for better and accurate prediction. The results are analyzed using popular metrics and compared with two benchmark ML classifiers and a recent classifier based on deep learning. The mean prediction accuracy achieved using proposed model is 59.25%, over number of stocks, which is much higher than benchmark approaches.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Although machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in forecasting the trend of stock market indices, they failed to consider the following crucial aspects for market forecasting: (1) that investors’ emotions and attitudes toward future market trends have material impacts on market trend forecasting (2) the length of past market data should be dynamically adjusted according to the market status and (3) the transition of market statutes should be considered when forecasting market trends. In this study, we proposed an innovative ML method to forecast China's stock market trends by addressing the three issues above. Specifically, sentimental factors (see Appendix [1] for full trans) were first collected to measure investors’ emotions and attitudes. Then, a non-stationary Markov chain (NMC) model was used to capture dynamic transitions of market statutes. We choose the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, namely, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( <italic>BERT</italic> ), to predict the state of the market at time <italic>t</italic> , and a long short-term memory ( <italic>LSTM</italic> ) model was used to estimate the varying length of past market data in market trend prediction, where the input of <italic>LSTM</italic> (the state of the market at time <italic>t</italic> ) was the output of <italic>BERT</italic> and probabilities for opening and closing of the gates in the <italic>LSTM</italic> model were based on outputs of the <italic>NMC</italic> model. Finally, the optimum parameters of the proposed algorithm were calculated using a reinforced learning-based deep Q-Network. Compared to existing forecasting methods, the proposed algorithm achieves better results with a forecasting accuracy of 61.77%, annualized return of 29.25%, and maximum losses of −8.29%. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved the lowest forecasting error: mean square error (0.095), root mean square error (0.0739), mean absolute error (0.104), and mean absolute percent error (15.1%). As a result, the proposed market forecasting model can help investors obtain more accurate market forecast information. </p>},

   abstract = {We demonstrate the application of an algorithmic trading strategy based upon the recently developed dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on portfolios of financial data. The method is capable of characterizing complex dynamical systems, in this case financial market dynamics, in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. By extracting key temporal coherent structures (portfolios) in its sampling window, it provides a regression to a best fit linear dynamical system, allowing for a predictive assessment of the market dynamics and informing an investment strategy. The data-driven analytics capitalizes on stock market patterns, either real or perceived, to inform buy/sell/hold investment decisions. Critical to the method is an associated learning algorithm that optimizes the sampling and prediction windows of the algorithm by discovering trading hot-spots. The underlying mathematical structure of the algorithms is rooted in methods from nonlinear dynamical systems and shows that the decomposition is an effective mathematical tool for data-driven discovery of market patterns.},

   abstract = {The description of coherent features of fluid flow is essential to our understanding of fluid-dynamical and transport processes. A method is introduced that is able to extract dynamic information from flow fields that are either generated by a (direct) numerical simulation or visualized/measured in a physical experiment. The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders},
