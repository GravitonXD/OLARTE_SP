\subsection{Machine Learning Model Diagram}
\label{subsec:ml_diagram}
In this section, the process on how the machine learning model 
was developed is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ml_model}. 
Wherein, the process overview is based on the Fine-Tuned Support 
Vector Regression Model for Stock Predictions by 
\citeA{Dash2016}.

\subsubsection{Data Collection}
\label{subsubsec:model_data_collection}
The market data used to develop the DMD-LSTM model was obtained through EODHD's 
end-of-day market data API. While PSEI market data was used for model 
training and testing, market data from other stocks was used for cross-validation 
of the DMD-LSTM model. The following are the specifics of the stocks gathered:

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{subsubsec:model_data_processing}
Data preprocessing is composed of three main processes which are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Data Cleaning - This was done to clean any missing values from the data.
    \item[(b)] Feature Selection - Closing prices was selected as the main feature of the model.
    \item[(c)] Splitting of Data - Data was split 80:20 for testing and training data, respectively.
\end{itemize}
