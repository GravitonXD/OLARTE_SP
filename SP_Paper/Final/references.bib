With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, various algorithms have been employed in order to predict the equity market movement. The combined application of statistics and machine learning algorithms have been designed either for predicting the opening price of the stock the very next day or understanding the long term market in the future. This paper explores the different techniques that are used in the prediction of share prices from traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to neural networks and graph-based approaches. It draws a detailed analysis of the techniques employed in predicting the stock prices as well as explores the challenges entailed along with the future scope of work in the domain.},

   abstract = {Stock price prediction is a challenging problem as the market is quite unpredictable. We propose a method for price prediction using Dynamic Mode Decomposition assuming stock market as a dynamic system. DMD is an equation free, data-driven, spatio-temporal algorithm which decomposes a system to modes that have predetermined temporal behaviour associated with them. These modes help us determine how the system evolves and the future state of the system can be predicted. We have used these modes for the predictive assessment of the stock market. diction results were compared with actual stock prices. We used Mean Absolute Percentage Error to calculate the deviation of predicted price from actual price for each company. We used three sampling approaches to sample the companies. In the first, we sampled companies belonging to the same sector to predict the future price. In the second, we considered sampled companies from four different sectors and in third, we used all the companies listed in NSE. For all the three approaches we made analysis using DMD as well as adaptive DMD. For DMD, the sampling as well as the prediction window size were fixed. For adaptive DMD, the sampling window was kept fixed, but predictions were made until it crossed a threshold error. When predicted values and actual values were plotted in the graph, the resulting curves were similar and close. Prediction was found to be more accurate when samples were taken from all the sectors, than from a single sector. When all 1721 companies listed in NSE were considered prediction was more accurate. When sampling window alone was fixed; the predictions could be made for longer period for certain instances of sampling. At other instances, the predictions could me made only lesser than 6 minutes.},

   abstract = {There has been much controversy over the casual dismissal of incumbent politicians of the impact of the downturn in the stock market on the Philippine economy. By far, prevailing literature has focused on the role that economic performance, or economic growth even, plays in the valuation of stocks of listed corporations in stock markets. This research seeks to focus on the role of the Philippine stock market as driver of economic performance. Here, the author looks into the relationship between economic performance, as measured by gross domestic product, and its touted drivers, stock market activity as measured by the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index and employment as measured by the unemployment rate. The author does not attempt to delve into the appropriateness of GDP as a measure of a country's wealth, as it is a flow rather than stock measure, and proceeds to examine empirical evidence to support correlational suggestions between the named variables. Data for the period 2006-2016 is analyzed to study the causal relationships mainly between the stock index and real GDP. Regression analysis is utilized to measure the relationships and the extent to which the Philippine stock market does drive national output. It is argued that stock market performance impacts positively on the country's economic output. Consequently, this research shows that there is empirical evidence to support the posited theoretical observation. Both the Philippine stock index and unemployment rate show significant positive and negative effect, respectively, on real GDP.},

Technical analysts often apply Technical Analysis (TA) on historical price data, which is an exhaustive task and might produce incorrect predictions. The machine learning coupled with fundamental and / or Technical Analysis also yields satisfactory results for stock market prediction. In this work an effort is made to predict the price and price trend of stocks by applying optimal Long Short Term Memory (O-LSTM) deep learning and adaptive Stock Technical Indicators (STIs). We also evaluated the model for taking buy-sell decision at the end of day. To optimize the deep learning task we utilized the concept of Correlation-Tensor built with appropriate STIs. The tensor with adaptive indicators is passed to the model for better and accurate prediction. The results are analyzed using popular metrics and compared with two benchmark ML classifiers and a recent classifier based on deep learning. The mean prediction accuracy achieved using proposed model is 59.25%, over number of stocks, which is much higher than benchmark approaches.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Although machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely used in forecasting the trend of stock market indices, they failed to consider the following crucial aspects for market forecasting: (1) that investors’ emotions and attitudes toward future market trends have material impacts on market trend forecasting (2) the length of past market data should be dynamically adjusted according to the market status and (3) the transition of market statutes should be considered when forecasting market trends. In this study, we proposed an innovative ML method to forecast China's stock market trends by addressing the three issues above. Specifically, sentimental factors (see Appendix [1] for full trans) were first collected to measure investors’ emotions and attitudes. Then, a non-stationary Markov chain (NMC) model was used to capture dynamic transitions of market statutes. We choose the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, namely, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( <italic>BERT</italic> ), to predict the state of the market at time <italic>t</italic> , and a long short-term memory ( <italic>LSTM</italic> ) model was used to estimate the varying length of past market data in market trend prediction, where the input of <italic>LSTM</italic> (the state of the market at time <italic>t</italic> ) was the output of <italic>BERT</italic> and probabilities for opening and closing of the gates in the <italic>LSTM</italic> model were based on outputs of the <italic>NMC</italic> model. Finally, the optimum parameters of the proposed algorithm were calculated using a reinforced learning-based deep Q-Network. Compared to existing forecasting methods, the proposed algorithm achieves better results with a forecasting accuracy of 61.77%, annualized return of 29.25%, and maximum losses of −8.29%. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved the lowest forecasting error: mean square error (0.095), root mean square error (0.0739), mean absolute error (0.104), and mean absolute percent error (15.1%). As a result, the proposed market forecasting model can help investors obtain more accurate market forecast information. </p>},

The method is capable of characterizing complex dynamical systems, in this case financial market dynamics, in an equation-free manner by decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. By extracting key temporal coherent structures (portfolios) in its sampling window, it provides a regression to a best fit linear dynamical system, allowing for a predictive assessment of the market dynamics and informing an investment strategy. The data-driven analytics capitalizes on stock market patterns, either real or perceived, to inform buy/sell/hold investment decisions. Critical to the method is an associated learning algorithm that optimizes the sampling and prediction windows of the algorithm by discovering trading hot-spots. The underlying mathematical structure of the algorithms is rooted in methods from nonlinear dynamical systems and shows that the decomposition is an effective mathematical tool for data-driven discovery of market patterns.},

   abstract = {The description of coherent features of fluid flow is essential to our understanding of fluid-dynamical and transport processes. A method is introduced that is able to extract dynamic information from flow fields that are either generated by a (direct) numerical simulation or visualized/measured in a physical experiment. The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders},
