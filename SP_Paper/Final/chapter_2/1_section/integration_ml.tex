\label{sec:integration_ml}
Stock market analysis is crucial for effective risk management. 
This involves using various methods, such as technical and fundamental 
analysis, to make informed decisions for investors and traders. 
In recent years, the growth of computing power and resources has 
led to the increasing use of machine learning techniques for stock market 
prediction and analysis. These advances help companies better predict upcoming 
market trends and make more informed decisions.

The integration of machine learning algorithms in the stock market is growing, 
as investors and traders increasingly rely on fast and accurate market information 
to reduce potential risks and make better decisions. These algorithms allow for 
more efficient analysis of market data, leading to more informed decisions and 
improved investment outcomes
