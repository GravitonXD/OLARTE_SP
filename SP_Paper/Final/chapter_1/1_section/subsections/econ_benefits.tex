% Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment
\subsection{Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment}
The stock market is widely acknowledged to play an important role in economic 
growth because it allocates and provides capital to businesses, which drives economic 
activity and growth. This is evident from the fact that stock market performance 
is frequently correlated with the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country.
\cite{TradeBrains, Hall2022, Bae2017}
Furthermore, historical stock price trends can provide insight 
into broader economic movements
\cite{Campbell2021}.

In a study conducted by \citeA{Balaba2017}, they discovered that the stock market
has a positive impact on the Philippines' economy. The study's findings showed that
as the stock market rose, the unemployment rate fell. This is because the performance 
of the stock market leads to job creation, which in turn leads to economic growth.
This, in turn, drives economic growth. This relationship was observed
in the Philippines from 2007 to 2017.
