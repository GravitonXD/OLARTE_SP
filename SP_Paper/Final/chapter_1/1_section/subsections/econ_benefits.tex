% Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment
\subsection{Economic Relevance and Benefits of Stock Market Investment}
It is commonly accepted that the stock market plays a crucial role in economic growth,
 as it allocates and provides capital to businesses, which in turn drives economic
  activity and growth. This is evident from the fact that stock market performance
   is often correlated with a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  
  \cite{TradeBrains, Hall2022, Bae2017}
  Additionally, historical trends in stock prices can provide insight into 
  broader economic movements 
\cite{Campbell2021}.

Moreover, a study by \citeA{Balaba2017} found that the stock market has a 
positive effect on the economy of the Philippines. The data from the study 
showed that as the stock market grew, the country's unemployment rate declined. 
This is because the stock market's performance leads to job creation, which in 
turn drives economic growth. This relationship has been evident in the Philippines 
for the past 10 years.
