\section{Background and Rationale}
\label{sec:background}
Investing in the stock market has numerous benefits for both the person and the economy. 
However, people are hesitant to begin because of its complexity. Furthermore, the stock market instruments 
available to the public in the Philippines do not cater to new investors: (a) features are frequently hidden 
behind a pay wall; and (b) provided stock market data is overwhelming and confusing.
\\

As a result of these problems, the researcher created a system to provide a publicly available, easy-to-use, 
data-driven, and accurate stock market tool designed primarily for the Philippine Stock Exchange.
\\

The system, referred to as 'alamSYS' throughout this study, differs from the few current stock market 
instruments in the Philippines. In comparison to these other tools, alamSYS provides a simplified way 
to analyze stocks by simply looking at its predictions of whether a stock should be bought or sold, and 
it is up to the users to further examine the stock using different analysis tools to make a more 
informed decision.
\\

Aside from that, alamSYS allows users to automate the process of selecting stocks on the Philippine Stock 
Exchange by utilizing DMD-LSTM and ALMACD, which are publically accessible via the system's web API component. 
Moreover, users can also implement their own machine learning models and trading algorithms, as the
source code of the alamSYS is open-sourced. Further details regarding the alamSYS and its components are discussed
in Chapters 3 and 4.
