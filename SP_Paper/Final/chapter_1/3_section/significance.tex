\section{Significance of the Study}
\label{sec:significance}
The significance of this developed system lies in its ability to greatly benefit 
the stock market, individual investors, and the economy as a whole.
In particular, the system addresses the following technological gaps:
(a) The lack of free and publicly available stock market prediction systems or tools;
(b) The time and resources required to study complex traditional 
market analysis tools, such as fundamental and technical analysis;
(c) The potential for inaccurate market decisions leading to significant 
investment losses; and
(d) The hesitancy of the Filipino public to begin 
investing in the Philippine stock market.
\\

Furthermore, contributions of the system to data-driven investing, financial protection 
and management, and economic development could provide a valuable resource for 
investors while also promoting financial stability and growth. Wherein, 
the creation of publicly accessible data-driven investing tools or systems may encourage 
more Filipinos to participate in the market and take control of their own 
financial future. Overall, the completion of this special problem has the 
potential to have a significant impact on the Philippine stock market and economy.

Specifically, this study is significant for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] The development of the alamSYS aims to provide the 
  following benefits to the Filipino people:
  (1)	Provides Filipino investors with fast, accurate,
  and relevant information for effective decision making in the stock market;
  (2)	Provide an intuitive and user-friendly application interface to 
  facilitate data-driven investment decisions; and 
  (3)	Provide a platform for all investors to participate in the stock market, regardless of their investment knowledge, educational attainment, and societal status.
  
  \item[(b)] The development of the alamSYS, aims to provide the following benefits 
  to the future developers or researchers:
  (1)	Provide a developmental framework for innovative stock market tools;
  (2)	Provide a system, where they can apply and test new machine learning
  models; and
  (3)	Provide an avenue to make stock market analysis and investing more
    accessible to the public.

  \item[(c)] The development of alamSYS could stimulate economic recovery and 
  development in the Philippines by increasing the number of local investors. 
  The benefits of the system could encourage more people to invest in the stock 
  market, leading to a multiplier effect that could benefit the economy 
  in several ways, such as job creation, lowering of unemployment rates, 
  fast developments and innovations in various industries, and increased consumer 
  spending - as indicated in a study by \citeA{Qamruzzaman2019}.
