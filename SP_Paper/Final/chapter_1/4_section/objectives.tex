This special problem aims to develop a system that makes investing easier, 
more publicly available, data-driven, and more approachable by minimizing both the 
time required for stock price trend analysis, and potential financial risk 
by using DMD-LSTM and integrate Arnaud Legoux Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (ALMACD)
as a trading algorithm. More specifically, it aims to do following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Develop a Data Preprocessor. Which includes a Data Collector Module (DCM), 
  which collects the end-of-day historical data of a stock from Mondays to Fridays. 
  The data collected is then processed by the Data Processor Module (DPM), which applies the
  deep learning model and integrate the trading algorithm to the data. Finally, the
  processed data is given to the Database Updater Module (DUM).
  \item[(b)] Develop a RESTful API, referred to as alamSYS, 
  using the combination of Python's FastAPI and MongoDB for API 
  endpoints and database, respectively.

  Specifically, this was done by doing the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.]	Develop the following API endpoints:
      \subitem 1.1	\texttt{Home} – This API endpoint outputs a welcome message. 
      Which should inform the user that they have successfully connected to the alamAPI.
      \subitem 1.2	\texttt{Stocks to Buy} – This API endpoint outputs a list of suggested 
      stocks to buy based from the current market price and the predicted price up-trend.
      \subitem 1.3 \texttt{Stocks to Sell} – This API endpoint outputs a list of suggested
      stocks to sell based from the current market price and the predicted price down-trend.
      \subitem 1.4  \texttt{Stocks Info} - This API endpoint outputs a list of stocks included 
      in the alamSYS and their corresponding information.
      \subitem 1.5  \texttt{ML Model Info} - This API endpoint outputs a list of the 
      Machine Learning Models used in the alamSYS and their corresponding information.
      \subitem 1.6 \texttt{Stocks Risks Info} - This API endpoint outputs a list 
      of the stocks included in the alamSYS and their corresponding 
      risks values based on value at risk (\%), volatility (\%), and drawdown (\%).
    \item[2.]	Develop a database that stores the results provided by the DPM,
    and other essential data such as stock information, deep learning model information,
    and stock risks information about the stock market that is needed to be provided.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[(c)] Develop a Stock Market Price Trend Forecasting 
  Deep Learning Models by utilizing the dynamic modes in DMD as an additional input 
  parameter to an LSTM model. Afterwards, integrate the forecasting with ALMACD as
  a trading algorithm and basis for entry and exit positions.
  \item[(d)] Finally, develop a mobile-based test application, which from hereon maybe referred to 
  as: alamAPP, to showcase the main functionalities of the developed RESTful API. 
  Specifically which stocks to buy and to sell for a given period of time.
