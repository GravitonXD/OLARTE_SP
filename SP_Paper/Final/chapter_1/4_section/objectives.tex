This special problem aims to develop a system that makes investing easier, 
more publicly available, data-driven, and more approachable by minimizing both the 
time required for stock price trend analysis, and potential financial risk 
by using Dynamic Mode - Long Short-Term Memory (DMD-LSTM) and integrate 
Arnaud Legoux Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (ALMACD) as a trading algorithm. 
More specifically, it aims to do following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Develop a system called alamSYS that can collect and process stock market data in order 
  to provide comprehensive stock position suggestions.
  \item[(b)] Develop a Stock Market Price Trend Forecasting 
  Deep Learning Model and integrate the forecasting with ALMACD as
  a trading algorithm and basis for entry and exit positions.
  \item[(c)] Finally, develop a mobile-based test application, which from hereon maybe referred to 
  as: alamAPP, to showcase the main functionalities of the developed RESTful API.
\end{itemize}
