\section{Statement of the Problem}
\label{sec:problem}
Despite the clear and functional benefits of investing in the stock market, 
many Filipinos remain hesitant to do so for the following reasons:
(a) the difficulties that come with learning the fundamentals 
of effective stock investing;
(b) the time-consuming nature of technical and fundamental analysis, 
especially for students and working people on a tight schedule; and
(c) the increased financial risk associated with stock market volatility, 
as well as the potential for emotional decision-making to jeopardize investments.
\\

Moreover, the lack of free and publicly available stock market predictive systems or tools 
currently creates a gap in the information available to the public when compared 
to large private individuals or institutions. Where, the public is 
disadvantaged by this information gap \cite{Kim2022}. 
\\

These factors \textit{(along with other external and internal factors not listed above)}
contribute to a lack of confidence and understanding among potential investors, 
making it difficult for them to take advantage of the opportunities offered 
by the stock market.
